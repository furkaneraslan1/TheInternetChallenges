# TheInternetChallenges

It's an automation script to test multiple test scenarios on The Internet Herokuapp, as well as demonstrates my skills of finding element locators and interacting with various types of elements such as dropdown menus, checkboxes, text fields, buttons, links, alerts, file uploads, and more.

# What I Learned
- Web Automation with Java, Selenium WebDriver, TestNG and Maven.

- Web Element Locator Strategies such as:
  - Identifiers
  - CSS Selectors
  - XPaths
  - Names
  
- Wait Strategies

- Test NG:
  - Annotations
  - XML Files
  - Priority Attributes
  - Assertions (Hard Asserts, Soft Asserts)
  
- Maven Architecture
